A Simple app to get your shift done! 

Front end: JavaScript 

<h1> Backend: Node.js MongoDB, Mongoose </h1> 

Notes: Did not use babel, which means no use of import (small detail, but can get 
annoying when one is used to import instead of require)


<h6 color="red"> Important: use node version 8.x otherwise you might run into a glitch...</h6>

<h1> Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript </h1>

Using XMLRequests here. 
Could have used webpack, this might helped me fix the 400 error I get.
